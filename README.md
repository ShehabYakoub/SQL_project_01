This project will focus on data cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using the 'world_layoffs' dataset which I've found online. The data range is between March 2022 and March 2023, and it includes many popular companies around the world like Amazon or Microsoft and it offers comprehensive data about these companies' layoffs.
In the 'cleaning_layoffs' file I've cleaned the data set using 4 main steps: 
  1- Removing Duplicates
  2- Standardizing Data
  3- Dealing with null or blank values
  4- Removing any unnecessary columns or rows
In the 'eda_layoffs' file I've categorized the data per multiple categories like year or company which gave me more clear insights about the whole dataset. One of these insights is that the total world layoffs from Jan 2022 till Oct 2022 were about 96,000 while the total layoffs from Oct 2022 to Mar 2022 were about 196,000 which means that only in 6 months the total layoffs were more than double the total layoffs in 11 months!!
